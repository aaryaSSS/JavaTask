Example Flow:

User enters circle, red, and 23 as inputs.
A Circle object is created: new Circle("red", 0, 0, 23).
This object is added to ArrayList<Shape> shapes.
Later, when iterating over the list:
calculateArea() is called → Calls Circle's overridden method → Returns Math.PI * radius * radius.
calculatePrice() is called → Calls Circle's overridden method → Applies a 1.5 multiplier since the color is red.
